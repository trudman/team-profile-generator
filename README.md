# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project was my Team Profile Generator using a CLI application created with node. This was a very challenging project for me and tested a lot of what I have learned in the program thus far. This was very helpful to troubleshoot through rendering the index.html file correctly. I had a really difficult time on writing the file but was finally able to successfully create it. This has really helped me to troubleshoot different problems in the code to debug and work through issues.

## Installation

To install the user must download the code from Github and install NPM on their machine in the project. To install you must open an integrated terminal and enter "npm init -y". From there they can open an integrated terminal and enter "node ." or "node index.js" to run the application. From there they will be prompted with several questions to generate your team.

## Usage

To use this team profile generator the user must first install NPM. Once the user runs the application using "node ." in an integrated terminal, a series of questions will populate to gather team information. The team information will be entered and an index.html file will be generated for them. The index.html file is styled with bootstrap.
